Firmware Loading Instructions:
The binary file, MAX32630_One_Wire_Interface_1.MAX32630FTHR - 2019-07-24T140013.301.bin, has a long name, but it can be loaded on to a MAX32630FTHR board by simply plugging in the board to a PC through a USB-to-Serial cable and connecting the Daplink programmer to the PC (and the small 10-pin cable that comes with it to the MAX32630FTHR).  Once connected, a new hard drive appears called "Daplink".  Simply drag and drop this file to the new drive icon to program the firmware into the MAX32630FTHR.
